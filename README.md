# CasaOS for AlmaLinux
Personal Fork of the [CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS) installation script, adapted for installation on AlmaLinux (but should be fine for Rocky/Centos as well)

To install CasaOS on Debian/Ubuntu, simply give the following command:

'''
wget -qO- https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash

'''
